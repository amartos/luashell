* Luashell

A very simple Lua interpreter + shell implementation in C++, as a
demo. It currently depends on Lua version =5.4= and GNU's =readline=
library.

** Configuration

The interpreter loads the file located at
=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/luashell/config.lua=, if it exists, before execution
of any script or the shell's prompt.

** Environment

The following globals are defined. You can easily redefine them in the
config file.

The =expected types= column contains a comma-separated list of types
that the shell expects to find stored in the variable; the functions
description syntax is: =rettype f(argtype, argtype, ...)=.

If no types are defined, the modification of the variable has no
effect on the interpreter's startup (the global is read-only, or
kind-of).

| BANNER   | ""                                   | the shell's banner            | string, string f() |
